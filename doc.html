    <h4>What is "Secret Sharing"?</h4>
    
    Citing from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>
    article about <a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_sharing">Secret
      Sharing</a>:
    <blockquote>
      <p>
	In <a
	  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography">cryptography</a>, a
	<b>secret sharing scheme</b> is a method for distributing a <a
	  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secrecy"><i>secret</i></a> amongst
	a group of participants, each of which is allocated a <i>share</i> of
	the secret. The secret can only be reconstructed when the shares are
	combined together; individual shares are of no use on their own.
      </p>
      <p>
	More formally, in a secret sharing scheme there is one <i>dealer</i>
	and <i>n</i> <i>players</i>. The dealer gives a secret to the players,
	but only when specific conditions are fulfilled. The dealer
	accomplishes this by giving each player a share in such a way that any
	group of <i>t</i> (for <i>threshold</i>) or more players can together
	reconstruct the secret but no group of less than <i>t</i> players
	can. Such a system is called a <i>(t,n)</i>-threshold scheme.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    A popular technique to implement threshold schemes uses
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_interpolation">
      polynomial interpolation</a> ("Lagrange interpolation"). This method
    was invented by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adi_Shamir">
      Adi Shamir</a> in 1979.
    <h4>Where is "Secret Sharing" used?</h4>
    Some popular examples are:
    <ul>
      <li>
	Good passwords are hard to memorize. A clever user could use a
	secret sharing scheme to generate a set of shares for a given
	password and store one share in his address book, one in his
	bank deposit safe, leave one share with a friend, etc. If he
	forgets his password one day, he can reconstruct it easily. Of
	course, writing passwords directly into the address book would
	pose a security risk, as it could be stolen by an "enemy". If
	a secret sharing scheme is used, the attacker has to steal
	many several shares from different places.
      </li>
      <li>
	"A dealer could send <i>t</i> shares, all of which are
	necessary to recover the original secret, to a single
	recipient, using <i>t</i> different channels. An attacker
	would have to intercept all <i>t</i> shares to recover the
	secret, a task which may be more difficult than intercepting a
	single message" (<a
	  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_sharing">Wikipedia</a>).
      </li>
      <li>
	The director of a bank could generate shares for the bank's
	vault unlocking code and hand them out to his employees. Even
	if the director is ill, the vault can be opened, but only,
	when a certain number of employees do it together. Here secret
	sharing schemes allow the employment of not fully trusted
	people.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>What is "ssss"?</h4>
    <p>
      <b>ssss</b> is an implementation of Shamir's secret sharing
      scheme for UNIX systems, tested only on linux machines until
      now. The code is licensed under the <a
      href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU GPL</a>.
      <b>ssss</b> does both the generation of shares for a known
      secret and the reconstruction of a secret using user provided
      shares.  The software was written in 2005 by B. Poettering, it
      links against the <a href="http://swox.com/gmp/">GNU libgmp</a>
      multiprecision library (version 4.1.4 in my case) and requires
      the <tt>/dev/random</tt> entropy source. Please send bug reports
      to <tt>bpssss AT point-at-infinity.org</tt>.

    <h4>How is "ssss" used?</h4> 
    <p>The generation of shares given a
      known secret is shown first.  A (3,5)-threshold scheme is used, that is:
      5 shares are generated, the secret can be reconstructed by any
      subset of size 3.
    </p>
    <pre>
      % ssss split -t 3 -n 5
      Generating shares using a (3,5) scheme with a 128 bit security level.
      Enter the secret, at most 16 ASCII characters: secretrootpasswd
      1-b3c512cda358a572bb2fd620ad8ca82a
      2-d82e615a8045d5fa1fba410207dc901f
      3-188e10e5466902e7cbe1e743d9234f57
      4-8ddce27e0ab71bfeef0de524bf6ddced
      5-4d7c93c1cc9bcce33b564365619203b7
    </pre>
    These shares can be combined to recreate the secret:
    <pre>
      % ssss combine -t 3
      Enter 3 shares separated by newlines:
      Share [1/3]: 3-188e10e5466902e7cbe1e743d9234f57
      Share [2/3]: 5-4d7c93c1cc9bcce33b564365619203b7
      Share [3/3]: 1-b3c512cda358a572bb2fd620ad8ca82a
      Resulting secret: secretrootpasswd
    </pre>

    <h4>What are the program's options?</h4>
    <pre>
      Syntax:
      ssss split -t threshold -n shares [-s level] [-w token] [-x] [-q]
      ssss combine -t threshold [-x] [-q]
      
      Commands:
      split: prompt the user for a secret and calculate a set of
      corresponding shares.
      
      combine: read in a set of shares and reconstruct the secret.
      
      Options:
      -t threshold
      the number of shares necessary to reconstruct the secret.
      
      -n shares
      the number of shares to be generated.
      
      -s level
      security level: the scheme's security level in bits. The security
      level is an upper bound for the length of the shared secret
      (shorter secrets are padded). Allowed values are 80, 112, 128,
      192, 256, 512 and 1024. The default is 128.
      
      -w token
      text token to name shares in order to avoid confusion in case you
      utilize secret sharing to protect several independent secrets. The
      generated shares are prefixed by these tokens.
      
      -x
      hex mode: use hexadecimal digits in place of ASCII characters for
      I/O. This is useful if you want to protect binary data, like
      block cipher keys.
      
      -q
      quiet mode: disable all unnecessary output. Useful in scripts.
      Note: the option -Q works like -q, but warnings are suppressed also.
